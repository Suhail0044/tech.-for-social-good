In our very first class we learned about  how a computer works inside. We talked about parts like the Address Line/Bus and Data Line/Bus.
These parts are very important because they help the memory and CPU share information and keep the computer running smoothly.
It was really interesting to see how all the parts are connected and work together to move and manage data inside the computer.
One of the most exciting things we learned was how a computer understands information. We found out that computers only understand binary numbers, which are made of just 1s and 0s.
We also learned the difference between regular numbers (decimal numbers) and binary numbers.
Our professor showed us how to change regular numbers into binary numbers and how to change them back again. It was fun to learn something so new!
How to change a Decimal Number to a Binary Number:
To change 64 into binary, we kept dividing by 2 and writing down the remainders:
64 ÷ 2 = 32, remainder 0
32 ÷ 2 = 16, remainder 0
16 ÷ 2 = 8, remainder 0
8 ÷ 2 = 4, remainder 0
4 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 0
2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0
1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1
Then, we read the remainders from bottom to top and got 1000000.
So, the binary form of 64 is 1000000.
How to change a Binary Number to a Decimal Number:
Now, to change 1000000 back into a decimal number:
(1 × 2⁶) + (0 × 2⁵) + (0 × 2⁴) + (0 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (0 × 2¹) + (0 × 2⁰)
This gives:
64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 64
So, 1000000 in binary is equal to 64 in decimal.
At the end of the class, the professor gave us one more practice question.
We had to convert a decimal number to binary and then check our answer by converting it back to decimal. After that, the class ended.
